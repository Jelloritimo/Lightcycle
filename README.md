# Lightcycle
Tron
Tron is originally a classic arcade game from 1982. Its game concept is similar to that of the snake game. The difference being the "tail" doesn't move with the player and instead it stays in place.

Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

python3 -m pip install raylib
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 Lightcycle

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
